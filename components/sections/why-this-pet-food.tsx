                We aim to provide wholesome treats and supplements to take care
                of your petsâ€™ nutritional requirements, with the additional
                benefits of addressing joint and skin health. We provide
                sustainable fish based pet food, through the use of
                overpopulated invasive freshwater fishes as a source of fish
                protein in pet food. It also provides an alternative source to
                wild caught/ farmed marine fish, with its high nutritional value
                and omega 3 fatty acids. Every purchase you make contributes
                towards river research and conservation projects.
